 * here {@code code = 500}

 * <br>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code String message=HTTPStatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.getMessage();}
 *     {@code String description=HTTPStatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.getDescription();}

	/*
	200 – OK – Eyerything is working
	201 – OK – New resource has been created
	204	– OK – The resource was successfully deleted

	304 – Not Modified – The client can use cached data

	400 – Bad Request – The request was invalid or cannot be served. The exact error should be explained in the error payload. E.g. „The JSON is not valid“
	401 – Unauthorized – The request requires an user authentication
	403 – Forbidden – The server understood the request, but is refusing it or the access is not allowed.
	404 – Not found – There is no resource behind the URI.
	405 - Method Not Allowed - When an HTTP method is being requested that isn't allowed for the authenticated user
	410 - Gone - Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions
	415 - Unsupported Media Type - If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request
	422 – Unprocessable Entity – Should be used if the server cannot process the enitity, e.g. if an image cannot be formatted or mandatory fields are missing in the payload.
	429 - Too Many Requests - When a request is rejected due to rate limiting
	500 – Internal Server Error – API developers should avoid this error. If an error occurs in the global catch blog, the stracktrace should be logged and not returned as response.
